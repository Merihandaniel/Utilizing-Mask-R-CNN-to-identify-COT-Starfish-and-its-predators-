## Utilizing Mask R-CNN to Identify COT Starfish and Its Predators
This project applies Mask R-CNN, a deep learning model, to automatically detect and segment Crown-of-Thorns (COT) Starfish and its predators in underwater images. The goal is to aid marine conservation efforts by providing a more efficient and accurate method of identifying these species in coral reef ecosystems.

## Technologies Used
- **Mask R-CNN** (Deep Learning)
- **TensorFlow** / **Keras**
- **OpenCV** for image processing
- **Python** (programming language)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for development and analysis
- **Matplotlib** / **Seaborn** for data visualization
